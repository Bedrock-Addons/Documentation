## Frequently Asked Questions

**Is this for gaming?** It started out that way, but has since been used for over 20 other large-scale projects completely unrelated to gaming.

**Is it secure?** Probably not, but I haven't done many security tests. I mostly just update code on the production server directly and hope no issues arise.

**Is it scalable?** Very. The software is being used in production by multiple organizations, and has a combined total of over 7 million users on Android.

**What's the difference between UAP and WordPress?** UAP is designed to be mobile-first, with optimizations already done for you. WordPress is web-first, and requires extensive modification to produce something that is unique and efficent.
