## Frequently Asked Questions

**Is this for gaming?** It started out that way, but has since been used for over 20 other projects completely unrelated to gaming.

**Is it secure?** Probably not, but I haven't done many security tests. I mostly just update code on the production server directly and hope no issues arise.

:::caution  
There's probably lots of vulnerabilities that I haven't even considered, so isolate it on it's own virtual machine, and implement good network security.
